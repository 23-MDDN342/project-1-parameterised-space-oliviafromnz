### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

README

Added extra panneling and framing the window. Will start to think how i want the roof to move, maybe a series of arcs dispersing from the centre window??


Thoughts: 

The wall "paintings, could immitate some of what Pheobe demonstrated with the lots and lots of dots (like pop art) in a grid and then it changes colour in colour lerp but specific colours? - use noise function?? 


Also could have window sky move in background to give atmosphere, but then do I have to add like shading? Could it make it too messy or is it more of a flat vector background?? Or do I commit to proper 3d - do I have time??
