### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

README

Edited and played with maps - went along with Tuesdays lecture. 

Then went into frontscroll.js and commented to understand the elements being drawn and manipulated. 

I then planned out the basic shapes I wanted to create for the background and started to get back into the groove of drawing these in relation to height and width, which I am still in the process of doing. 

So far we have:

Two opposing walls joined by a centre semi circle window, with an arched ceiling for the hallway. The idea is to use the front scrolling method to draw arcs coming from behind the window to the back of the ceiling to front. The celing will then be maped in a way to emit different colours through the noise function.

The pictures on the wall will be using the noise function too with lots of tiny dots, slightly changing to showcase the livley paintings displayed down the chapel's hallway.
