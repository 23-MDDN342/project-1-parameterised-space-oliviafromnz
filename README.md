### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

I am currently in Italy, Roma. 
I took inspiration from the The Sancta Sanctorum which I visited earlier this week on a random stroll. The Sanata Sanctorum is a Roman Catholic chapel of the Lateran Palace in Rome. It was the original private chapel of the papacy before it moved to Avignon, and later to the Vatican Palace. 

Although, I havent looked too much into the history of this chapel, the roofs like other places in Roma are absolutley breathtaking. I thought why wouldnt anyone want this as a background in a boring old work zoom meeting? 

My idea is to use the front scrolling js to help me immitate the infite pictures on the ceiling shown in the sketch.jpg. The hiope is to have a grand atmosphere, as if the ceiling is talking to you with bright colours. Obviously my skillset is limited rtegarding creating all the beutiful imagery, but I would like to someway immitate the colour pallete or message of each squasre somehow in the final product.
