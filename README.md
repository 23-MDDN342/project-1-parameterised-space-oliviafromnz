### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

README

This backgorund is called: Roman Chapel Awakes (Based on the Holy Stairs)

The Concept:
As the night approaches, the tourists of the roman chapels slowly exit the building, leaving the beautiful intricate paintings full of faces and animals all alone. The hallways are empty until the church darkens. Then the toy story effect starts, the ceiling moulding glistens gold and the paintings start to talk to each other. The ceiling turns into a full on moving playground and the chapel is alive. 

This ambient, grand, luxurious yet playfully illustrated chapel hallway background gives zoom users a fun atmosphere to conduct any meeting or catch up. As you sit in the centre, colours fly above you and gold glistens on either side of you.
